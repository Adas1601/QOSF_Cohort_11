n Dimensional Qubit State Preparation — README

A small utility to prepare, display and validate normalized quantum state vectors (kets)

This repository contains a compact Python implementation to create, display and test normalized quantum states for n qubits.
It exposes a State_Preparation class for programmatic use and a simple CLI for manual entry. Unit tests illustrate expected behavior and edge cases.
